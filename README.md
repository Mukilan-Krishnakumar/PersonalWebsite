## List of Resources:

### 1. Web Design:

Aesthetics of our website dictates the user experience and user retention. [Figma](https://www.figma.com/resources/learn-design/) offers free web design courses which covers everything we need to WireFrame our website. 

### 2. HTML:

HTML provides the structure for our webpages and it hardly takes a day to learn. I would always recommend free tutorials to begin with. You can learn HTML from [freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/pQN-pnXPaVg). 

### 3. CSS:

CSS provides styling to our HTML pages. Check out this comprehensive course on [CSS](https://youtu.be/1Rs2ND1ryYc). I would recommend learning the basics and testing it out for yourself. 

### 4. JavaScript:

JavaScript provides the necessary functionality for our website. If you are a complete newbie then you can go through this comprehensive course by [freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/PkZNo7MFNFg). If you have worked on JavaScript before and want to learn React, then I would highly recommend going through educative.io’s course called “[JavaScript Fundamentals Before Learning React](https://www.educative.io/courses/javascript-fundamentals-before-learning-react)”.  This course should be available to you for free if you are GitHub Student Developer. 

### 5. React:

React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building single page applications. Learning React can make our applications more functional and maintainable. FrontEnd Masters provide wonderful courses on anything front end related. We are going to go through two such courses: “[Complete Intro to React, v6](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/complete-react-v6/)” and “[Intermediate React, v3](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/intermediate-react-v3/)”. All these courses are free with GitHub student Developer pack. 

### 6. Nodejs:

We will be using Node to perform backend-API services. The best resource to learn Node js is from the [Learn page](https://nodejs.dev/learn). It covers everything we need to know about Node js and provides hands-on coding experience to practice our skills. 

### 7. MongoDB:

MongoDB is an open source NoSQL database management program. We will be using MongoDB to store our user and blog data. The best resource to learn MongoDB is from their free online courses called [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/dashboard). M001 is the perfect place to start for absolute beginners.

### 8. Express:

We are going to use Express for routing our Web application. [Express Docs](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) provide the best tutorial for learning Express js. 

### 9. Sass:

SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets) is a CSS preprocessor. It is much more easier and flexible than CSS. Educative.io’s course “[Sass for CSS: Advanced Frontend Development](https://www.educative.io/courses/sass-for-css)**”**  is the perfect place to start. 

### 10. Software Architecture:

Software architecture is an important skill to have in our tool kit. It is almost an essential in any developer job. Educative.io’s course “**[Web Application and Software Architecture 101](https://www.educative.io/courses/web-application-software-architecture-101)**” is the only resource we need to learn Software Architecture. 

### 11. Hosting and Domain Selection:

Hosting our website is a lot like showcasing our product. When we hit publish, our website goes live and anyone from any part of the world can visit our brain child and interact with it. The best domain selection website, purely opinionated, is [Google Domains](https://domains.google/intl/en_in/). It offers domains for a relatively cheap price and more security. We are going to host our website in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). 

### 12. Search Engine Optimisation:

Search Engine Optimisation is a vital part to increasing our web traffic and improving our business. Google provides a comprehensive guide on [SEO](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/beginner/seo-starter-guide) and how to make our websites more visible in the rankings.

### 13. CertBot:

Certbot is a free, open source software tool for automatically using [Let’s Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificates on manually-administrated websites to enable HTTPS. You can learn more about CertBot [here](https://certbot.eff.org/pages/about).

### 14. Marketing:

Digital marketing is a necessary component for spreading the word about our site and services we offer. Google offers a [Digital Marketing Course](https://learndigital.withgoogle.com/digitalgarage/course/digital-marketing) which is absolutely free.
